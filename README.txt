===============================================

tabstats is a basic chrome extension that tracks the number
of open tabs in chrome

you can always open the chrome extension to see the number of
tabs open and the number of tab related events (opening + closing
of tabs)

you can also click the graph button and see a (somewhat) pretty
graph of the history of your recent tab adventures. on this graph,
you can adjust the display options so that you can see data points,
filling, connecting lines, horizontal guidelines, and vertical
guidelines. you can also change the timeframe of your tab
adventures.

a basic server-side backend with appengine was also implemented to
keep track of long-term tab histories of a user.

FUTURE PLANS include...
- allowing users to change the color of various display features of the graph
- sharing your own chart via various social media sites (g+, fb, etc.)
- comparing your chart with friends with overlaying or other cool things
- going to sleep
- making a more interactive graph with sliders, shiny buttons, etc.
- going to a new york city hackathon together
